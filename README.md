# Java WebServer

## NOTES:

- Given a single client, is it possible to reuse the same connection for its subsequent requests?
- Can I use the same thread for different connections?
- Can I use a JAR file - that has an entrypoint - as a library?
- What is the best way to benchmark this?
- Should I use Maven or something like that in the case that I don't have external libraries?

## TODO:

- Refactor the code
- Add more features and flexibility
- Add logging
